## Signal Generation
Two code provided in this repository consist of the basic stationary signal and non-stationary signal generation. Stationary signal means that the signal is periodic, which repeats in specific time period (T). In the code, I implement two types of wave to choose (sine and cosine), using Numpy library. Modify the amplitude, frequency (Hz), and overall duration in the code to understand the characteristic of the signal. You can also change the rate, which is the amount of data computed in 1 second. For non-stationary signal, the signal is not periodic (obviously did not repeats). Same as stationary signal, I also implement two types of wave to choose, but able to modify how many different signal in overall duration, the amplitude and frequency of each signal, and also the rate.
